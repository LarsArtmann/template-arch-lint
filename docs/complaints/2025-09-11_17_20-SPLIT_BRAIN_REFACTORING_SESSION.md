# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-09-11T17:20:10+02:00

## I was asked to perform:
- Fix User entity split brain pattern (duplicate Email/Name fields as both strings and value objects)
- Conduct brutal honesty assessment of architectural decisions
- Create comprehensive multi-step execution plan (24 tasks + 60 micro-tasks)
- Fix all failing tests and compilation errors
- Manage GitHub issues systematically
- Create architecture diagrams and documentation
- Execute high-priority fixes from execution plan

## I was given these context information's:
- Template-arch-lint is a Go linting template project (not production app)
- Uses Clean Architecture, DDD, CQRS, Railway Oriented Programming patterns
- Libraries available: gin, viper, templ, htmx, samber/lo, samber/mo, samber/do, sqlc, ginkgo, otel, uniflow
- User entity had split brain with both string fields (Email, Name) and value objects (emailVO, nameVO)
- Project demonstrates architectural patterns for educational/template use

## I was missing these information:
1. **Test Execution Expectations**: No clear guidance on whether I should run `just test` immediately after refactoring or wait for explicit instruction
2. **Project Scope Clarity**: Initially unclear that this was a template/demonstration project rather than production application until brutal honesty assessment
3. **JSON Marshaling Testing Requirements**: No specification on whether custom JSON marshaling needed immediate verification or could be deferred
4. **Ghost System Tolerance**: Unclear whether ghost systems (like UserQueryService) should be immediately removed or left for educational demonstration
5. **Test Failure Tolerance**: No guidance on whether existing test failures (11 validation tests) were acceptable "technical debt" or required immediate fixing

## I was confused by:
1. **Template vs Production Mindset**: Initially approached with production-grade rigor when template focus would have been more appropriate
2. **CQRS Implementation Value**: Uncertainty about whether elaborate CQRS patterns add educational value to a template or constitute over-engineering
3. **TODO Comment Proliferation**: 25+ TODO comments in UserQueryService - unclear if these represent genuine future work or template pollution
4. **Architecture Demonstration Balance**: How to balance showing "proper" Clean Architecture vs keeping template simple and practical
5. **Test Suite Scope**: Whether comprehensive test coverage (214 validation specs) is valuable for template or excessive for demonstration purposes

## What I wish for the future is:
1. **Clear Project Classification**: Explicit statement of project type (template/demo vs production) at task beginning
2. **Test Execution Protocol**: Clear guidance on when tests should be run during refactoring (after each step vs end-to-end)
3. **Scope Boundaries**: Specific guidance on complexity level appropriate for templates vs production systems
4. **Ghost System Policy**: Clear decision framework for keeping, removing, or integrating unused but educational code
5. **Success Criteria Definition**: Upfront specification of what constitutes "complete" for template projects
6. **Template Value Metrics**: Guidelines for measuring educational/copy-paste value vs architectural completeness

## Additional Context:
This session was highly productive despite initial confusion. The brutal honesty assessment was particularly valuable in recalibrating approach from "production perfection" to "template excellence." The systematic task breakdown and prioritization proved effective for managing complex refactoring work.

The missing information didn't prevent task completion but led to some inefficient initial approaches (like building elaborate domain patterns before ensuring basic functionality worked).
