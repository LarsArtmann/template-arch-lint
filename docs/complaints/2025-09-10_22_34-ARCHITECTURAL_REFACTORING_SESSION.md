# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-09-10T22:34:25+02:00

I was asked to perform:
Comprehensive architectural refactoring of the Go template-arch-lint project, including:
- Fix UserID ValidationError wrapping (102 failing tests)
- Replace fmt.Printf with structured logging
- Extract services following CQRS patterns
- Create comprehensive execution plans with Pareto analysis
- Generate architecture diagrams
- Manage GitHub issues
- Create complete documentation

I was given these context information's:
- Existing codebase with 526-line UserService violating SRP
- Planning document with Pareto analysis (80/20, 64/4, 51/1)
- User preferences for Go, gin, templ, HTMX, samber/lo libraries
- Requirements for brutally honest feedback and comprehensive planning
- Instruction to use multiple agents and split work into 5 groups
- Clear prioritization: work vs impact analysis

I was missing these information:
1. **Repository Interface Contract**: Had to discover UserRepository methods (FindAll vs List) during implementation
2. **Value Object API Surface**: Had to research GetEmail() vs GetName() method signatures and return types
3. **UserFilters Structure**: Assumed field names (EmailDomain, NameContains) that didn't exist in actual struct
4. **Existing Architecture State**: Would have benefited from current architecture diagram before starting
5. **Test Failure Root Cause**: Had to investigate why 102 tests were failing (ValidationError type mismatches)
6. **Build Pipeline Requirements**: Discovered pre-commit hooks and formatting requirements during commit process

I was confused by:
1. **Ghost System Definition**: Initially unclear what constituted a "ghost system" vs legitimate work-in-progress
2. **Split Brain vs Architectural Debt**: Some ambiguity between what constitutes split brain vs normal refactoring debt
3. **Service Extraction Scope**: Unclear how much of the 526-line service to extract in first iteration
4. **Library Usage Expectations**: Should I leverage existing patterns vs create new ones (samber/lo usage level)
5. **Documentation Scope**: Unclear whether to create implementation docs vs architectural decision records
6. **Error Handling Philosophy**: Mixed signals on whether to standardize on Result[T] vs traditional Go errors

What I wish for the future is:
1. **Architecture Discovery Phase**: Always start with current state diagram before refactoring
2. **Interface Contract Documentation**: Clear API surface documentation for existing abstractions
3. **Test Failure Analysis**: Automated analysis of why tests fail before architectural changes
4. **Incremental Validation**: More frequent compilation/test runs during implementation
5. **Library Usage Guidelines**: Clear documentation on when/how to use existing patterns vs creating new
6. **Split Brain Detection**: Automated tooling to identify split brain patterns in codebase
7. **Refactoring Checkpoints**: Predefined stopping points to validate progress vs plan
8. **Better Type Inference**: Tooling to understand value object contracts without manual investigation

## Additional Technical Notes

### Implementation Learnings:
- Always read existing interfaces before implementing new ones
- Value objects require careful string conversion (.String() methods)
- Repository method naming inconsistencies create friction
- Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting before commits
- Multiple agent coordination requires clear task boundaries

### Architectural Insights:
- CQRS service extraction requires understanding existing repository contracts
- Value object integration touches many layers simultaneously  
- Type safety improvements have cascading effects on entire codebase
- Functional programming patterns (Result[T], Option[T]) require systematic adoption

### Process Improvements:
- Create current architecture diagram BEFORE starting major refactoring
- Validate compilation after each significant change
- Use more incremental commits for complex architectural changes
- Research existing patterns before creating new abstractions
- Test early and often during service extraction

This session demonstrated the complexity of systematic architectural refactoring and the importance of understanding existing contracts before implementing new abstractions.
