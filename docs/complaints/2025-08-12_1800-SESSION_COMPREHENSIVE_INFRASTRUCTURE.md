# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

Date: 2025-08-12T18:00:42+02:00

I was asked to perform:
A comprehensive dual-objective implementation: (1) Create mermaid.js execution graph for ALL GitHub Issues and internal TODOs with multi-stage execution, research tasks, and dependencies, AND (2) Achieve production readiness for the template-arch-lint Go application using Pareto analysis (1% → 51% → 64% → 80% value delivery). This included creating comprehensive plans with 30-100min tasks (max 30) broken down into 12min micro-tasks (max 100), executed via parallel Task agents (up to 10 groups), continuing until everything is finished and verified. Additionally, I was asked to be brutally honest, identify ghost systems, focus on customer value, leverage existing libraries, and follow established architecture patterns.

I was given these context information's:
- Working directory: /Users/larsartmann/projects/template-arch-lint
- Git repository status and recent commits
- Existing codebase with Go application, gin, viper, templ, HTMX, SQLite
- GitHub Issues #2-8 with specific requirements
- User preferences for functional programming, Clean Architecture, DDD, CQRS
- Technology stack preferences: Go, gin-gonic/gin, spf13/viper, a-h/templ, htmx, sqlc-dev/sqlc, samber/lo, samber/do, OpenTelemetry
- Instructions to use existing libraries fully and avoid reinventing wheels
- Emphasis on git commits after each change and final git push

I was missing these information:
1. **Clear Definition of "Production Readiness"**: While I inferred this meant CI/CD, monitoring, containerization, etc., specific production requirements were not clearly defined upfront. This led to potential over-engineering in some areas.

2. **Customer/User Context**: The target audience for this template was not specified. Is it for individual developers, enterprise teams, specific industries? This would have guided prioritization better.

3. **Resource Constraints**: No specific time limits, budget constraints, or team size context was provided, which led to creating comprehensive solutions that might exceed practical needs.

4. **Integration Testing Environment**: No information about available testing environments, Docker daemon availability, or local setup constraints that would affect testing capabilities.

5. **Specific Library Versions**: While preferred libraries were mentioned, specific version requirements or compatibility constraints weren't provided, leading to some potential version conflicts.

I was confused by:
1. **Scope Boundaries**: The instruction to "keep going until everything works and you think you did a great job" with "ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD" was confusing because it's unclear what constitutes "everything" in a template project context.

2. **Ghost System Definition**: While asked to identify and eliminate ghost systems, the definition of what qualifies as a "ghost system" versus necessary infrastructure wasn't initially clear.

3. **Pareto Analysis Application**: Applying Pareto principle (1% → 51% → 64% → 80%) to a development project required interpretation of what constitutes "value delivery" in a template context.

4. **Parallel Execution Scope**: Instructions to "spawn up to 10 Tasks at once" but then limit to 5 groups was initially confusing about the optimal parallelization strategy.

5. **Brutally Honest Assessment**: The request for brutal honesty was appreciated but the specific format and level of detail expected for this assessment could have been clearer upfront.

What I wish for the future is:
1. **Clear Success Criteria**: Specific, measurable definitions of what constitutes "production ready" or "complete" for different types of projects.

2. **User Context Specification**: Clear definition of target users, use cases, and environments to guide prioritization and scope decisions.

3. **Constraint Definition**: Clear resource, time, and environment constraints to prevent over-engineering and focus on practical solutions.

4. **Testing Environment Specification**: Information about available testing infrastructure, Docker setups, and local environment constraints.

5. **Library Version Matrix**: Specific version compatibility requirements or version ranges for preferred libraries to avoid integration issues.

6. **Template vs Production Clarity**: Clear distinction between what belongs in a development template versus production application infrastructure.

7. **Incremental Validation Points**: Defined checkpoints where partial work can be validated before proceeding to more complex implementations.

8. **Ghost System Criteria**: Clear framework for identifying unnecessary complexity versus legitimate infrastructure needs.
