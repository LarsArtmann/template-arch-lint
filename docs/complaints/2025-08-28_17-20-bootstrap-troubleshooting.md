# Report about missing/under-specified/confusing information

I was asked to perform:
Create troubleshooting commands for bootstrap failure scenarios (PHASE 2.2) as part of comprehensive bootstrap reliability improvements.

I was given these context information's:
- Previous TODO list from Pareto analysis optimization
- Bootstrap.sh script with error handling
- Multiple test scripts showing failure scenarios
- User demand for "EVEN easier and more reliable" bootstrap experience

I was missing these information:
- Clear guidance on whether to integrate troubleshooting INTO bootstrap.sh vs creating separate tools
- Architecture patterns for self-diagnosing and self-repairing scripts
- Whether separate troubleshooting tools violate DRY principle and create maintenance overhead
- Integration requirements with existing justfile commands

I was confused by:
- Whether creating standalone troubleshooting scripts aligns with "one way to do it" principle
- How to balance comprehensive diagnostics vs simplicity
- Whether users want separate tools or integrated experience
- Relationship between bootstrap.sh error handling and external troubleshooting

What I wish for the future is:
- Clear architectural guidance on tool integration vs separation
- Explicit requirements about self-repairing capabilities
- Design patterns for robust installation scripts with integrated diagnostics
- Guidelines for when to create separate tools vs enhance existing ones
