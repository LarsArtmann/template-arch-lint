   - ✅ Created `internal/application/dto/user_dto.go`
   - ✅ Added HTTP server with Gin framework
   - ✅ Added graceful shutdown with signal handling
   - ✅ Added health check endpoint (`/health`)

3. **Architecture Enforcement ENHANCED**
   - ✅ Added application layer to go-arch-lint configuration
   - ✅ Fixed architecture boundaries for handlers/DTOs
   - ✅ Maintained single main.go constraint
   - ✅ Ensured proper dependency flow: Infrastructure → Application → Domain

#### **🏗️ TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- **Enterprise HTTP API:** Full CRUD endpoints (`/api/v1/users`)
- **Type-Safe DTOs:** Request/response validation with proper error handling
- **Dependency Injection:** Manual DI pattern with clean separation
- **Structured Logging:** All handlers use enterprise logging patterns

## 🔍 **CRITICAL INSIGHTS & LESSONS LEARNED**

### **🎯 WHAT WORKED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL:**
1. **Architecture Enforcement:** go-arch-lint provided perfect boundary validation
2. **Layer Separation:** Clean dependency flow was maintained throughout
3. **Type Safety:** Value objects prevented runtime errors effectively
4. **Linter Integration:** 40+ linters ensured enterprise-grade code quality
5. **Domain-Driven Design:** Rich domain entities with business logic worked perfectly

### **🚨 CRITICAL CHALLENGES FACED:**
1. **Method Signature Discovery:** Had to reverse-engineer domain service methods
2. **Entity Access Patterns:** Complex getter/setter patterns for value objects
3. **Error Consistency:** Domain errors vs HTTP response mapping complexity
4. **Dependency Management:** Required careful import/dependency tracking
5. **Testing Integration:** Complete API test layer still needed

### **🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**
1. **Interface Documentation:** Better method signature discovery needed
2. **Error Mapping Strategy:** Standardized domain → HTTP error conversion
3. **Validation Architecture:** Clear separation between domain vs HTTP validation
4. **Dependency Injection:** Container-based DI for complex applications
5. **Testing Strategy:** Comprehensive API testing framework

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DECISIONS NEEDED**

### **🤔 ARCHITECTURAL QUESTIONS:**
1. **Validation Architecture:** Should HTTP validation be separate from domain validation?
2. **Error Mapping Strategy:** How to standardize domain → HTTP error conversion?
3. **Testing Approach:** Unit tests for handlers vs integration tests for full API?
4. **Database Transactions:** Should domain services manage transactions or repository layer?
5. **Dependency Scope:** Should services be singletons or request-scoped?

### **❓ IMMEDIATE GUIDANCE NEEDED:**
**Primary Question:** Should application layer DTOs contain validation rules, or should all validation stay strictly in domain layer?

**Current State:** 
- Handlers use gin binding validation (application layer)
- Domain entities have their own validation (domain layer)
- Risk: Duplicate validation rules leading to inconsistencies
