## 📊 Quality Gates

### Code Quality Requirements
- ✅ Zero linting violations (golangci-lint)
- ✅ Architecture boundaries enforced (go-arch-lint)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities (gosec + govulncheck)
- ✅ No race conditions detected
- ✅ Function length ≤ 50 lines
- ✅ Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10
- ✅ No `interface{}`, `any`, or `panic()` usage

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ 80% minimum test coverage
- ✅ All tests pass across Go versions
- ✅ Race condition detection clean
- ✅ Integration tests pass
- ✅ Benchmarks establish performance baseline

### Build Requirements
- ✅ Builds successfully on all platforms
- ✅ Templates generate without errors
- ✅ Executables run and respond to health checks
- ✅ Docker images build and start correctly
- ✅ Dependencies verified and vulnerability-free

## 🚀 Workflow Execution Strategy

### Parallel Execution
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Push/PR] --> B[Pre-checks]
    B --> C[Lint Matrix]
    B --> D[Test Matrix]
    B --> E[Build Matrix]
    C --> F[Security Scan]
    D --> G[Coverage Analysis]
    E --> H[Docker Build]
    F --> I[Status Summary]
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

### Matrix Strategies
- **Go Versions**: 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24
- **Platforms**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Test Types**: Unit, Integration, Race, Benchmarks

### Fail-Fast Strategy
- Pre-checks fail fast on basic issues
- Matrix jobs continue even if some versions fail
- Final success gates require all critical jobs to pass

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- Go module cache shared across workflows
- Tool installations cached per workflow
- Dependency downloads optimized

### Resource Management
- Appropriate timeouts for each job type
- Concurrent job limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Artifact retention optimized (30 days)

### Efficiency Features
- Quick pre-flight checks to fail early
- Parallel execution where possible
- Conditional steps based on Go version/platform
- Smart artifact uploading (only on specific versions)

## 🔐 Security Features

### Vulnerability Scanning
- `govulncheck` for Go-specific vulnerabilities
- `gosec` for security best practices
- Dependency tree analysis
- Container security (when Docker is used)

### Secret Management
- Codecov token support (when configured)
- No hardcoded secrets in workflows
- Secure artifact handling

## 📦 Artifact Management

### Generated Artifacts
- **Lint Reports**: JSON, XML, HTML formats
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML and text summaries  
- **Benchmark Results**: Performance baselines
- **Dependency Analysis**: Graph and listing
- **Build Artifacts**: Cross-platform executables

### Retention Policy
- 30 days for all artifacts
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat
- Critical reports always preserved

## 🔄 Integration with Project

### Justfile Integration
The workflows extensively use the project's `justfile` commands:
- `just install`: Tool installation
- `just lint`: Complete linting suite
- `just test`: Test execution with coverage
- `just build`: Template generation and building
- `just fix`: Auto-formatting and fixes

### Configuration Files
- `.golangci.yml`: Maximum strictness linting rules
- `.go-arch-lint.yml`: Clean Architecture enforcement
- `go.mod`: Dependency and version management

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

### For Developers
```bash
# Run same checks locally as CI
just install  # Install all tools
just lint     # Run all linting  
just test     # Run tests with coverage
just build    # Build and verify
```

### For Repository Setup
1. Ensure all configuration files are present
2. Add repository secrets if using external services:
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` (optional): For coverage reporting
3. Workflows will automatically run on push/PR

### For Customization
- **Go Versions**: Update matrix in workflow files
- **Coverage Threshold**: Modify `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` in test.yml
- **Tool Versions**: Update in workflow env sections
- **Quality Rules**: Modify .golangci.yml and .go-arch-lint.yml
