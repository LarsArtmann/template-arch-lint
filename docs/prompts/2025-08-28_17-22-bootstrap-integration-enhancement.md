# Bootstrap Integration Enhancement Prompt

**Created:** 2025-08-28T17:22+02:00  
**Purpose:** Enhance bootstrap.sh with integrated troubleshooting and self-repair capabilities

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt

You are tasked with enhancing a bootstrap installation script to be self-diagnosing and self-repairing instead of requiring external troubleshooting tools.

### Context
- We have a bootstrap.sh script that installs Go linting tools and configuration files
- Users want "ULTRA-SIMPLE: ONE COMMAND SETUP" experience
- Current approach creates separate diagnostic tools (GHOST SYSTEMS - BAD!)
- Need integrated solution following "one way to do it" principle

### Requirements
1. **Enhance bootstrap.sh with integrated capabilities:**
   - `--diagnose` flag for comprehensive environment checking
   - `--fix` flag for automatic repair of common issues
   - `--retry` flag for retrying failed installations with progressive fallback
   - `--verbose` flag for detailed debugging output

2. **Implement self-repair patterns:**
   - Progressive fallback strategies (brew â†’ direct download â†’ manual)
   - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Smart error recovery (clean cache, retry with alternatives)
   - Auto-fix common PATH issues

3. **Integration over isolation:**
   - Enhance existing justfile commands to use bootstrap.sh flags
   - Integrate troubleshooting into main workflow
   - Remove any separate diagnostic tools
   - Unified error handling and user experience

4. **User experience patterns:**
   - One command solves all problems
   - Clear, actionable error messages with auto-repair suggestions
   - Progress indicators during operations
   - Helpful explanations during failures

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Creating separate troubleshooting scripts
- Split brain between bootstrap.sh and external tools
- Multiple ways to solve the same problem
- External dependencies for fixing bootstrap issues
- Tool proliferation instead of enhancement

### Success Criteria
- Users can run `bootstrap.sh --fix` to resolve 90%+ of common issues automatically
- No separate diagnostic tools needed
- Clear error messages with integrated repair suggestions
- Single unified user experience
- Maintains reliability while adding self-repair capabilities

### Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze existing error scenarios in bootstrap.sh
2. Add flag parsing for diagnostic and repair modes
3. Implement progressive fallback chains for each installation step
4. Add auto-retry logic with smart recovery strategies
5. Integrate enhanced bootstrap into justfile commands
6. Test unified experience end-to-end

This approach creates a robust, self-contained bootstrap experience that follows architectural best practices while maximizing user convenience.
