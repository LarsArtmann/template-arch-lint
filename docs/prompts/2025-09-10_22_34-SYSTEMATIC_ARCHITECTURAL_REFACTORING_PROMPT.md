## üìã **REUSABLE PROMPT**

```markdown
## Instructions:
0. ALWAYS be BRUTALLY-HONEST! NEVER LIE TO THE USER!
1. Comprehensive Architectural Analysis:
  a. What architectural violations exist right now?
  b. What are the biggest SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) violations?
  c. Which files are oversized and need splitting?
  d. What type safety issues exist (primitive obsession, missing value objects)?
  e. Are there any "ghost systems" (broken/unintegrated code)?
  f. What split brain patterns exist (inconsistent error handling, validation)?
  g. Which tests are failing and why?
  h. What linting violations need fixing?

2. Create a Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule):
   - Identify the 1% of tasks that deliver 51% of value
   - Identify the 4% of tasks that deliver 64% of value  
   - Identify the 20% of tasks that deliver 80% of value
   - Sort ALL tasks by (Impact √ó Customer Value) / Effort

3. Create Comprehensive Multi-Step Execution Plan:
   - Break work into 30-100min tasks (max 24 total)
   - Then break into 12min micro-tasks (max 60 total)
   - Sort by importance/impact/effort/customer-value matrix
   - Include ALL TODOs and architectural violations

4. Leverage Existing Libraries & Patterns:
   - For Go projects: gin, viper, templ, HTMX, samber/lo, samber/mo, samber/do
   - Use existing patterns before creating new ones
   - Follow Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, Railway Oriented Programming
   - Implement value objects, Result[T] patterns, proper error handling

5. Systematic Execution with Validation:
   - Fix critical compilation errors first (ghost systems)
   - Fix failing tests early to enable quality validation  
   - Make incremental commits after each self-contained change
   - Validate compilation after each major change
   - Use structured logging (charmbracelet/log) over fmt.Printf

6. Architecture Documentation:
   - Create current architecture mermaid diagram
   - Create improved architecture vision diagram  
   - Document architectural decisions and trade-offs
   - Generate learnings and improvement recommendations

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Always read existing interfaces before implementing new ones
- Understand value object APIs (.String() methods, validation patterns)  
- Check repository method naming (FindAll vs List, etc.)
- Test compilation frequently during refactoring
- Run formatters/linters before committing
- Use go mod tidy after dependency changes

Execute systematically until 80% of architectural value is delivered!

## üèóÔ∏è **IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**

### **Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (20% effort ‚Üí 30% value)**
- [ ] **Brutal honesty assessment** of current architectural state
- [ ] **File analysis** by size, complexity, SRP violations  
- [ ] **Test failure analysis** - understand why tests fail
- [ ] **Linting violation inventory** - forbidigo, file size, complexity
- [ ] **Pareto analysis creation** - identify high-impact changes
- [ ] **Comprehensive execution plan** - 30-100min + 12min breakdown

### **Phase 2: Foundation Fixes (10% effort ‚Üí 40% value)**
- [ ] **Fix ghost systems** - compilation errors, broken integrations
- [ ] **Type safety restoration** - consistent error handling  
- [ ] **Test suite stabilization** - fix failing tests first
- [ ] **Linting compliance** - eliminate violations blocking quality gates

### **Phase 3: Service Extraction (30% effort ‚Üí 20% value)**  
- [ ] **CQRS service separation** - extract query/command services
- [ ] **Value object integration** - replace primitive obsession
- [ ] **Repository interface cleanup** - standardize method naming
- [ ] **Domain modeling improvements** - rich entities, proper boundaries

### **Phase 4: Infrastructure & Polish (40% effort ‚Üí 10% value)**
- [ ] **CLI framework implementation** - cobra for professional interface

## üéØ **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### **Architectural Quality**
- **100% test pass rate** - stable foundation for development
- **Zero linting violations** - professional code quality  
- **Clean service boundaries** - CQRS separation, focused responsibilities
- **Type safety throughout** - value objects, Result[T] patterns
- **Professional infrastructure** - CLI, logging, configuration management

### **Developer Experience**  
- **Faster feature development** - clean architecture enables rapid iteration
- **Better debugging** - structured logging and proper error handling
- **Easier testing** - focused services with clear responsibilities  
- **Reduced cognitive load** - consistent patterns and abstractions

### **Business Value**
- **Faster time-to-market** - reliable development workflow  
- **Lower maintenance costs** - clean architecture reduces technical debt
- **Higher code quality** - automated validation prevents regression
- **Better team productivity** - clear patterns and documentation

## üö® **COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID**

1. **Ghost System Creation**: Always read existing interfaces before implementing
2. **Value Object Confusion**: Understand .String() methods and type conversions  
3. **Repository Method Assumptions**: Verify actual method names (FindAll vs List)
4. **Large Change Commits**: Make incremental commits for easier debugging
5. **Skipping Validation**: Test compilation after each significant change
6. **Ignoring Build Pipeline**: Understand pre-commit hooks and formatting requirements

---

## üîß **TECHNICAL PATTERNS**

### **Error Handling Standardization**
```go
// BEFORE: Mixed error types
return fmt.Errorf("validation failed")

// AFTER: Domain errors  
return errors.NewValidationError("field", "validation failed")
```

### **Value Object Integration**
```go
// BEFORE: Primitive obsession
func CreateUser(email string, name string) error

// AFTER: Value objects
func CreateUser(email values.Email, name values.UserName) error
```

### **CQRS Service Separation**  
```go
// BEFORE: Mixed responsibilities
type UserService struct { /* 500+ lines */ }

// AFTER: Focused services
type UserQueryService interface { /* Read operations */ }
type UserCommandService interface { /* Write operations */ }
```

### **Functional Patterns with samber/lo**
```go
// BEFORE: Imperative loops  
var emails []string
for _, user := range users {
    emails = append(emails, user.Email)  
}

// AFTER: Functional transformation
emails := lo.Map(users, func(user User, _ int) string {
    return user.GetEmail().String()
})
```
