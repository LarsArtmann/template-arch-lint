   - **Effort**: 1 hour implementation

9. **Offline Installation Support**
   - Allow bootstrap to work with pre-downloaded files
   - Support air-gapped environments
   - **Impact**: Enterprise compliance requirements
   - **Effort**: 1.5 hours implementation

10. **Bootstrap Analytics**
    - Optional telemetry to track bootstrap success rates
    - Identify common failure points
    - **Impact**: Data-driven improvement insights
    - **Effort**: 2 hours implementation

11. **Configuration Customization**
    - Allow users to selectively install components
    - Support different strictness levels
    - **Impact**: Broader appeal for different team needs
    - **Effort**: 2 hours implementation

12. **Integration Testing Suite**
    - Automated tests for bootstrap across different environments
    - CI pipeline to test installation reliability
    - **Impact**: Prevents regressions
    - **Effort**: 3 hours setup

13. **Advanced Troubleshooting Tools**
    - `just doctor` command for diagnosing issues
    - Environment validation and repair tools
    - **Impact**: Reduces support burden
    - **Effort**: 2 hours implementation

## Strategic Implementation Order

### **Phase 1: Critical Reliability (1% → 51% value)**
Focus on making the bootstrap bulletproof for real-world usage:
1. Bootstrap script reliability testing
2. PATH handling verification  
3. Bootstrap success verification

### **Phase 2: High-Impact Polish (4% → 64% value)**
Expand compatibility and reduce friction:
4. Error recovery documentation
5. Windows WSL support
6. CI/CD integration guide
7. Bootstrap performance optimization

### **Phase 3: Complete Experience (20% → 80% value)**  
Add enterprise features and comprehensive tooling:
8-13. All remaining items for full enterprise readiness

## Success Metrics

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- Bootstrap works in 3 different Docker environments
- Tools immediately available after installation (no PATH issues)
- Final verification step shows green "everything works" confirmation

**Phase 2 Success Criteria:**
- Troubleshooting guide resolves 80% of reported issues
- Windows WSL compatibility confirmed
- CI/CD examples copy-paste ready

**Phase 3 Success Criteria:**
- Zero known compatibility issues
- Full offline installation support
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Context & Rationale

This analysis focuses on the remaining improvements after our major bootstrap implementation. We've already achieved the biggest wins (one-command setup, enterprise error handling, clear documentation), so we're now optimizing for the edge cases and advanced scenarios that will make this solution truly bulletproof.

The 1% actions are specifically chosen because they address the most common real-world failure modes: installation environment variations, PATH configuration issues, and user confidence in successful setup. These small fixes prevent the vast majority of support requests.

The 4% actions expand our addressable market and reduce operational overhead. Windows support alone opens up significant adoption, while error recovery documentation dramatically reduces support burden.

The 20% actions transform this from a great tool into an enterprise-grade solution suitable for large organizations with complex requirements.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 items in order
2. Verify each improvement before moving to next
3. Update this document with results and learnings
4. Proceed to Phase 2 once Phase 1 is verified working
