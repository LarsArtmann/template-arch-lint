- `/test/performance_test.go` - Performance benchmarking and baseline validation
- `/test/monitoring_test.go` - Monitoring and observability endpoint testing
- `/test/security_test.go` - Security vulnerability and protection testing

## Key Testing Features Implemented

### BDD Testing Framework
- Uses Ginkgo v2 for behavior-driven development testing
- Gomega matchers for expressive assertions
- Structured test organization with Describe/Context/It blocks

### Comprehensive Test Scenarios
- **Happy path testing** - Normal operation flows
- **Edge case testing** - Boundary conditions and limits
- **Error path testing** - Failure scenarios and error handling
- **Security testing** - Protection against common attacks
- **Performance testing** - Baseline and regression testing
- **Concurrency testing** - Thread-safety and race conditions

### Testing Best Practices
- **Test isolation** - Each test is independent
- **Test data management** - Proper setup and teardown
- **Mock and stub usage** - In-memory repositories for testing
- **Performance baselines** - Defined performance expectations
- **Security validation** - Protection against OWASP top 10
