# 🔥 CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline implemented for the template-arch-lint Go application. The pipeline provides enterprise-grade automation with security, quality, and testing enforcement.

## 🏗️ Pipeline Structure

### Available Workflows

1. **ci.yml** - Complete CI/CD pipeline (with architecture linting)
2. **ci-working.yml** - Working CI/CD pipeline (architecture linting disabled temporarily)
3. **env.yml** - Shared environment configuration

- Security: 10 minutes
- Build: 10 minutes
- Quality: 15 minutes
- Test: 15 minutes
- Integration: 10 minutes
- Final Validation: 5 minutes

## 🔧 Tools Integration

### Code Quality Tools

1. **golangci-lint** - Comprehensive Go linting
   - Configuration: `.golangci.yml`
   - Strictness: Maximum (enterprise-grade)
   - Output: Colored console + XML reports

2. **go-arch-lint** - Architecture validation
   - Configuration: `.go-arch-lint.yml`
   - Status: Temporarily disabled due to import issues
   - Purpose: Enforce clean architecture boundaries

### Security Tools

1. **CodeQL** - Static security analysis
   - Languages: Go
   - Queries: Security and quality focused
   - Integration: GitHub Security tab

2. **Trivy** - Vulnerability scanning
   - Scope: Filesystem scanning
   - Severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM
   - Output: SARIF format

### Testing Tools

1. **Go Test** - Native Go testing
   - Race detection enabled
   - Coverage reporting
   - Timeout: 10 minutes

2. **Ginkgo/Gomega** - BDD testing framework
   - Used for domain and handler tests
   - Rich assertion library

## 📊 Quality Gates

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum coverage: 80% (configurable)
- Race condition detection: Enabled
- Timeout protection: 10 minutes

### Code Quality Metrics
- Cyclomatic complexity: Max 10
- Function length: Max 50 lines
- Zero tolerance for security issues

### Security Requirements
- No high/critical vulnerabilities
- CodeQL security checks pass
- Dependency security verified

## 🚨 Current Issues

### Architecture Linting
**Status**: Disabled in ci-working.yml
**Issue**: go-arch-lint import resolution error
**Error**: `package without types was imported`
**Workaround**: Use ci-working.yml until resolved

### Resolution Steps
1. Fix import cycles in container package
2. Update architecture configuration
3. Re-enable architecture linting
4. Switch back to ci.yml

## 📈 Monitoring & Reporting
