- **Current State**: Dependency injection, error handling, testing infrastructure
- **Missing**: Enhanced testing patterns, performance benchmarks
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Dependencies**: Issue #10

#### Issue #3: Architecture (60% → 100%)  
- **Current State**: Clean architecture layers, repository patterns
- **Missing**: Advanced domain patterns, event sourcing setup
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours
- **Dependencies**: Issue #2

#### Issue #4: Web & API (70% → 100%)
- **Current State**: Gin server, basic handlers, middleware
- **Missing**: Advanced API patterns, OpenAPI docs, rate limiting
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours  
- **Dependencies**: Issue #3

#### Issue #5: Data & Config (50% → 100%)
- **Current State**: Basic configuration management
- **Missing**: Database migrations, observability, advanced config patterns
- **Effort**: 3-4 hours
- **Dependencies**: Issue #4

### 🚀 Stage 3: Production Readiness
**Estimated: 6-8 hours**

#### Issue #6: CI/CD & Deployment (5% → 100%)
- **Current State**: Basic GitHub Actions
- **Missing**: Complete CI/CD pipeline, containerization, deployment automation
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Dependencies**: Issues #2-#5 complete

### 📝 Stage 4: Documentation & Governance
**Estimated: 2-3 hours**

#### Issue #9: Architecture Decision Record
- **Scope**: Document template-justfile integration strategy
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Dependencies**: Issue #10
- **Deliverables**: Complete ADR with implementation details

## 📊 Resource Allocation & Risk Assessment

### High-Value, Low-Risk Issues
1. **Issue #10** - Tool version fix (30 min, no dependencies)
2. **Issue #9** - ADR documentation (1-2 hours, low complexity)
3. **Issue #11** - Work summary (ongoing, 30 min increments)

### High-Value, Medium-Risk Issues  
1. **Issue #2** - Foundation completion (existing 75% progress)
2. **Issue #4** - Web & API completion (existing 70% progress)
3. **Issue #3** - Architecture completion (existing 60% progress)

### High-Value, High-Risk Issues
1. **Issue #5** - Data & Config (only 50% complete, database complexity)
2. **Issue #6** - CI/CD & Deployment (only 5% complete, infrastructure complexity)

## 🔧 Execution Recommendations

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Issues #9 & #10** can be worked simultaneously (documentation vs. code)
- **Issues #2 & #3** have some parallel work potential (testing vs. domain patterns)

### Sequential Dependencies (Must Follow Order)
1. **Issue #8** → **Issue #10** → **Issue #2** → **Issue #3** → **Issue #4** → **Issue #5** → **Issue #6**
2. **Issue #9** can start after **Issue #10**
3. **Issue #11** runs parallel throughout

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Code Quality**: Address 156 linting issues incrementally per issue
- **Integration Testing**: Verify each component integration before moving forward
- **Documentation**: Keep ADR updated as architectural decisions are made

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Per-Issue Completion Criteria
- **All tests pass** with new implementations
- **Zero linting violations** for modified code sections  
- **Integration tests verify** component interactions
- **Documentation updated** for new features

### Overall Project Success
- **Template demonstrates enterprise-grade standards** 
- **Zero tolerance for quality violations** actually enforced
- **Real-world usability** proven through testing
- **Complete template-justfile integration** working end-to-end
